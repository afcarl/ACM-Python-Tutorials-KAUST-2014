The tutorials are logically split into 3 parts: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced levels. Each tutorial level is given on a separate day. The morning sessions of the tutorials cover general Python topics of various levels; the afternoon sessions are devoted to specific techniques, packages, and problems that could be easily solved with Python. Finally, we have a 2-hour session on MPI with Python.
